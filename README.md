# Grocery shopping app

This project is for pure fun, and a rewamp of my [old groceries proect](https://github.com/phillipj/groceries).
No seriousness involved, just trying out new stuff.

## Get it running

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).*
